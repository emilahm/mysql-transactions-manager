# Transaction Processing Script

---
A Python CLI tool for managing a transactions database, uploading CSV data, and querying for results. This tool allows
you to:

- Setup the MySQL database and tables for transaction management.
- Upload a transactions CSV file into a temporary staging table, fix any data, and then load the cleaned data into the
  final tables.
- Query the database for the latest transactions and total amounts spent by customers at a given store for a certain
  product.

## Requirements

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
2. **MySQL Server** (locally or remotely accessible).
3. **`mysql-connector-python`** library for Python (install via `pip install mysql-connector-python`).
4. A **CSV file** to import (by default, the script points to `./transactions.csv`).

The CSV file must contain the following columns with exact column names:

| Column Name               | Example Value | Description                                               |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| transaction_id            | TX1234        | Unique ID for each transaction (any alphanumeric string). |
| transaction_date          | 2023-01-15    | Date of the transaction in YYYY-MM-DD format.             |
| product_name              | cappuccino    | Name of the product purchased.                            |
| price                     | 4.50          | Price of the product (decimal value).                     |
| store_name                | King St       | Name of the store where the sale occurred.                |
| sales_representative_name | John Smith    | Sales representative who facilitated the transaction.     |
| client_name               | Jane Doe      | Client/Customer name.                                     |

## Data Model

The script creates and manages the following tables where the database is normalized to the 3<sup>rd</sup> normal form:

<p>
   <img src="./diagrams/transactions-ERD.png" alt="Transactions database"/>
</p>

**Staging table**:
<p>
   <img src="./diagrams/transactions-temp.png" width="400" height="auto" alt="Staging table diagram"/>
</p>

The `transactions_temp` table is used for staging data from the CSV. Once loaded, data can be adjusted or fixed (e.g.,
updating certain prices) before being inserted into the final tables (`stores`, `clients`, `products`,
`sales_representatives`, and `transactions`).

## Findings and Key Decisions

- Based on the given CSV file Clients, Stores, Sales Representatives can be uniquely identified by their names only. 
This is enforced with UNIQUE indexing in the tables.
- While exploring the data, I noticed that the price of `cappuccino` for transaction with `id q232` (4.00) does not 
match is not consistent with pricing in other transactions across stores and customers. To fix the issue before 
inserting data to the tables, `update` query is run to set prices for cappuccinos in staging table to 4.50 - majority rule.
- Additionally, because of the price mismatch, the product prices might change from store to store. To be able to correctly
identify product across the stores, a composite index is crated on product-name and store-id in products. This will enforce
that product with the same name cannot have different prices at the same store.
- The UNIQUE constraint on names will optimize the queries, since the queries are parameterized by names. (e.g. store - King St, product - tea).

---

- When setting up the database I believe I have already introduced enough constraints. For now the amount of data is tiny
and to introduce further constraints will not have any noticeable gains. If under real workload the performance suffers
then further indexing might be considered. This is also the reason why some of the obvious `foreign key` relations have not
been modeled, such as `sales representative -> store` or `customer -> store`, since I do not believe that they are necessary
for the purposes of task while introducing extra complexity.
- The `get_customers` query has cost of `1.7`, `get_customers_sort` query has cost of `3.03`. For both queries cost of `0.566` 
is result of `Correlated Subquery`, which is evaluated for every row.
- The `get_customers_sort` query does `Unique Index Scan (Index lookup)` twice wih cost of about `0.5`.
- I optimized `get_customers_sort_optim` by using `window functions` and `CTE` to progressively build the final table
and avoid duplicate joins. Window functions are used since they generally faster than correlated subqueries. The final
result is cost of `0.681` for optimized query.

P.S. I would like to note that performance gains for optimized query will be noticeable with large amounts of data. 
Some of the optimization constraints might be unnecessary if the table has limited number of rows.

## Setup

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Make sure you have MySQL installed and a running MySQL server. Then install the Python dependencies:

```sh
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

## Usage

The script uses a sub-command style CLI:

```sh
python transactions_manager.py [OPTIONS] <SUBCOMMAND> [SUBCOMMAND OPTIONS]
```

### CLI Commands

| Command  | Description                                                                                               |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `setup`  | Creates (if needed) a specified database and all required tables.                                         |
| `upload` | Uploads CSV data into the database (via `transactions_temp` table) and then inserts it into final tables. |
| `query`  | Performs a predefined query on the database to retrieve data.                                             |

### Examples

1. **Setting up the Database**
   ```sh
   python transactions_manager.py \
      --db-user root \
      --db-password mypassword \
      --db-host 127.0.0.1 \
      --db-port 3306 \
      setup \
      --db-name transactions
   ```
   What happens:
    1. Connects to MySQL using the provided credentials.
    2. Creates the `transactions` database (if not already present).
    3. Switches to use the `transactions` database.
    4. Creates the required tables (`clients`, `sales_representatives`, `stores`, `products`, `transactions`,
       `transactions_temp`) if they do not exist.

2. **Uploading CSV Data**
   ```sh
   python transactions_manager.py \
      --db-user root \
      --db-password mypassword \
      --db-host 127.0.0.1 \
      --db-port 3306 \
      upload \
      --db-name transactions \
      --csv-file ./my_transactions.csv
   ```
   What happens:
    1. Connects to MySQL and switches to the `transactions` database.
    2. Reads data from `my_transactions.csv`.
    3. Loads all rows into `transactions_temp`.
    4. Performs any fix-ups on the temp data (for example, updating the price for certain products).
    5. Inserts new stores, clients, products, and sales representatives into their respective tables if they donâ€™t
       already exist.
    6. Inserts the transactions into the `transactions` table.

3. **Querying**
   ```sh
   python transactions_manager.py \
      --db-user root \
      --db-password mypassword \
      --db-host 127.0.0.1 \
      --db-port 3306 \
      query \
      --db-name transactions \
      --store-name "King St" \
      --product-name "cappuccino" \
      --query-name get_customers_sort
   ```
   What happens:
    1. Connects to MySQL and switches to the `transactions` database.
    2. Runs the specified query (`get_customers_sort`) against the transactions data.
    3. Outputs the results to the console in a formatted table showing the `client_id`, `client_name`,
       `transaction_date`, and `total_spent` in descending order of total spent.

   );
   ```

   ```sql
   INSERT IGNORE INTO products (name, price, store_id)
   SELECT DISTINCT t.product_name, t.price, s.id
   FROM transactions_temp t
   JOIN stores s ON t.store_name = s.name
   WHERE NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM products p WHERE p.name = t.product_name
   );
   ```

   ```sql
   INSERT IGNORE INTO transactions
   SELECT
      t.transaction_id,
      t.transaction_date,
      p.id AS product_id,
      s.id AS store_id,
      c.id AS client_id,
      sr.id AS sales_repr_id
   FROM transactions_temp t
   JOIN stores s ON t.store_name = s.name
   JOIN products p ON t.product_name = p.name AND p.store_id = s.id
   JOIN clients c ON t.client_name = c.name
   JOIN sales_representatives sr ON t.sales_representative_name = sr.name;
   ```

These insertions are done using `INSERT IGNORE` to avoid duplicating records if they already exist.
